## Material-UI
- It is a popular library that provides predesigned components and styles for building user interfaces in React.
- It helps make your app look nice and consistent without needing to create all the design elements from scratch.
- **Example:** Imagine you want to create a button with a certain style. Instead of writing CSS and HTML for that button, you can use a ready-made button component from Material-UI and customize it as needed.

## Socket.io:
- It is a library that allows real-time communication b/w server and client.
- It's like a continuous conversation channel between the two, which is useful for features like chat or video calling.
- **Example:** Think of it as passing messages between two people through a walkie-talkie. When one person talks, the other person can hear and respond instantly.

## CORS
- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
- CORS is a security feature that controls how different websites or servers interact with each other's data. It prevents unauthorised access to resources on one domain from another domain.
- **Example:** Imagine you have a website at www.example.com Without CORS, other websites wouldn't be able to fetch or interact with data from [www.example.com](http://www.example.com/) for security reasons.

## Express
- Express is a web application framework for Node.js. It simplifies the process of creating web servers and handling HTTP requests, making it easier to build the backend part of your application.
- **Example:** Think of Express as a set of tools that help you build a restaurant kitchen. You don't need to create every cooking utensil from scratch; you can use the tools provided by Express to create routes (like menu items) and handle requests (like customer orders).
