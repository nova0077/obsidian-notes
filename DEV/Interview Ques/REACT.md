1. State: It is basically a javascript variable, whenever the value updates it will trigger a re-render of our react application.
2. StateManagement: there are 2 ways to manage states in react
	- Redux 
	- Context API => (built in react)
3. Hook rules:
	- only call hooks on the highest level, not in functions
	- Can be used in components, cannot call in class components.
4. Design Patterns: 
	- MVC is a design pattern where you divide your project into 3 components
		1. Model
		2. Views
		3. Controllers
	they all have different functionalities & communication systems but they all interact with each other, so that our code always be more organised.
